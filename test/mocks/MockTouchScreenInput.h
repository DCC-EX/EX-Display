/// "button" area of the screen that's been touched.
/// @details Use setTouch(int touchX, int touchY) and setScreenResolution(int width, int height) to set the
/// screen dimensions and simulate user touches (default 320 x 240). Call setDebounceHold(bool debounceHold) to enable
/// and disable debounce tests as well as touch position (default false). Call check() before/after time advances to
/// test debounce and hold.

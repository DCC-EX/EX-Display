 * DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE! Copy it to myDevices.h and edit that.
 * Each available type has an example and description.
 * Note that there are no default devices as there are too many available user options to provide a sensible default.

 * Each display has an auto generated ID starting at 0, and these are generated in the order the displays are defined in
